# Object Detection using SIFT Feature Matching

This project implements object detection in images using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) feature matching with OpenCV. The code can detect a query object within a target image and draw a bounding box around the detected object.

## Features

- SIFT feature detection and matching
- Homography-based object localization
- Visual feedback with matched features
- Error handling and validation
- Support for various image formats

## Requirements

```python
opencv-python>=4.5.0
numpy>=1.19.0
